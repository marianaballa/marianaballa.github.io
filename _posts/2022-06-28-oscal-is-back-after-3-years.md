Back in March 2020, only 2 months away from the 7th edition of OSCAL, everything was cancelled indefinitely. 3 years later and the 2-day open source conference happened again in Tirana.  Normally, I am very happy to be among all these amazing open source people but this year it was even better since we hadn't met in person in such a long time.

The conference lasts two consecutive days, it has: 
* two parallel presentation tracks
* one workshop track  
* a designated area for infobooths by various open source projects

### Infobooths
The conference had 7 infobooths this year:

- LibreOffice 
- Zextras 
- openSUSE 
- Fedora 
- phpList 
- SCiDEV 
- Open Labs

### openSUSE Summit 
Alongside OSCAL, we had the openSUSE Summit. openSUSE folks travelled to Tirana and held presentations. Douglas DeMaio hosted the keynote presentation of OSCAL2022. 

### My presentation on "Open Source for Business" 
I had a presentation about the importance of meeting digital needs, regardless of industry, for every business. Of course, I approached my presentation from an open source perspective and showcased some easy-to-use solutions that can apply to most Small and Mid-size Enterprises (SMEs). 

### Sponsors & supporters
OSCAL is organized on a volunteer basis by the members of Open Labs Hackerspace and very good friends of the hackerspace! The conference would be possible without our amazing volunteers, sponsors and supporters! OSCAL 2022 was sponsored and supported by: 
* openSUSE
* ZexTras & EUforInnovation
* The Fedora Project & LibreOffice
* homezone.al & EngageTechnology
* Stickermule
* Tirana Youth Capital 2022 & phpList
* A2CNN
