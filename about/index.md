Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is Mariana Balla, but I guess you already know that since you are hereâ€¦

I am a [Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO)](https://bcert.me/srqpqrvos) who enjoys product planning, implementation, and successful releases. My approach involves close collaboration with the stakeholders, a commitment to Scrum principles, and the application of my knowledge acquired during my [Information & Communication Technology (ICT)](https://fshn.edu.al/Departments/departamenti-i-informatikes/Programmes/teknologji-informacioni-bsc) university degree.

Throughout my professional endeavors, I've leveraged a variety of tools for effective product management and user community outreach. Some of my favorite and most familiar tools are:
- Email: for seamless communication and reporting.
- Jira: as a robust platform for issue and project tracking.
- Slack & Mattermost: for instant communication within teams.
- Zoom: for facilitating efficient video conferencing.
- Loom: for detailed screen recording.
- Figma & Miro: for visualized planning and collaborative efforts.
- Linux-based operating systems: serving as my primary OS.
- Git (version control system): for meticulous file change tracking.
- GitHub & GitLab: as reliable platforms for collaborative version control.
- phpList: for efficient bulk email sending.

Having utilized these tools, I've effectively managed products, overseen projects, and engaged in user community outreach. If your company uses similar tools or is looking to explore new solutions, I would be happy to put effort into getting myself familiar with new tools.

How can I help you:
- Create a comprehensive development roadmap for your product.
- Track development progress and provide insightful reports.
- Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to identify and address minor bugs and malfunctions before the final launch.
- Craft detailed changelog announcements for every release, outlining the list of changes.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's a specific way I can assist you in your endeavors. Looking forward to connecting and collaborating!
